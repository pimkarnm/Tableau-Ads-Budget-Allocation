# Data-Driven Strategic Recommendations and Business Report

**Project Overview**

As a marketing manager of a company, you would like to spend some advertising dollars to boost the sales of your products. Therefore, you need to deliver a presentation to your boss for budget approval. Your boss is interested in knowing about the sales situation of the sub-category over the most recent 12-month period. In addition to publishing the interactive dashboard on Tableau Public for your boss to view, you are also required to write a business report for your boss to tell him/her which sub-category and which cities (or states) you are planning on spending most of your advertising budget.
